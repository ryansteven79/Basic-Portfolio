            <p>I have been in the computer graphics industry for the last 19 years. The last four years I have had the pleasure of being the Production Manager at Pacific Digital Image, a prepress company in San Francisco. Here I managed the workflow, timelines, individual personalities, and made sure projects were completed with accuracy and precision.</p>
            <p>I was the point person for consulting with account representatives for production on large campaigns. I loved finding the most efficient and cost effective ways to complete projects and also enjoyed managing the QC department as the projects left the shop.</p>
